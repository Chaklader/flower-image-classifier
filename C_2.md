#### Sigmoid Functions and Activation Functions

Activation functions form the beating heart of neural networks. Without them, even the most complex neural network would
collapse into nothing more than a glorified linear regression model. These special functions introduce the non-linearity
that enables neural networks to learn intricate patterns and relationships in data, essentially giving networks their
power to approximate any function given enough neurons.

##### Sigmoid Function Properties and Derivatives

The sigmoid function (also called the logistic function) is one of the oldest and most historically significant
activation functions in neural networks. It creates an S-shaped curve that smoothly maps any input value to an output
between 0 and 1.

Mathematically, the sigmoid function is defined as:

$$\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$$

To understand why this function is so important, let's explore its key properties:

1. **Bounded output (0 to 1)**: No matter how extreme your input values are—whether extremely positive or extremely
   negative—the sigmoid function always produces an output between 0 and 1. This makes it naturally suitable for
   representing probabilities.

    For example:

    - When x = 0, σ(x) = 0.5
    - As x approaches +∞, σ(x) approaches 1
    - As x approaches -∞, σ(x) approaches 0

2. **Smoothness**: The sigmoid function is continuously differentiable everywhere, meaning it has a well-defined
   derivative at every point. This property is crucial for gradient-based learning algorithms like backpropagation.

3. **Monotonicity**: The function strictly increases across its entire domain—larger inputs always produce larger
   outputs. This consistent behavior helps neural networks maintain stable learning dynamics.

4. **Symmetry**: The sigmoid function has point symmetry around (0, 0.5), meaning its shape is perfectly balanced. This
   symmetry provides a natural midpoint at x = 0, where the function outputs exactly 0.5.

One of the most elegant aspects of the sigmoid function is its derivative, which can be expressed in terms of the
function itself:

$$\sigma'(x) = \sigma(x)(1-\sigma(x))$$

Let's derive this step by step:

Starting with the definition: $\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}$

Applying the chain rule: $\sigma'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}\right)$

Using the quotient rule: $\sigma'(x) = \frac{0 \cdot (1+e^{-x}) - 1 \cdot (-e^{-x})}{(1+e^{-x})^2}$

Simplifying: $\sigma'(x) = \frac{e^{-x}}{(1+e^{-x})^2}$

Now, observe that: $\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}$ and $1-\sigma(x) = \frac{e^{-x}}{1+e^{-x}}$

Multiplying these terms:
$\sigma(x)(1-\sigma(x)) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-x}} \cdot \frac{e^{-x}}{1+e^{-x}} = \frac{e^{-x}}{(1+e^{-x})^2} = \sigma'(x)$

This elegant relationship makes computing the derivative very efficient during neural network training—you can calculate
the derivative directly from the function's output without redoing the exponential calculation.

However, this same relationship reveals the sigmoid's greatest weakness: when the input has a large magnitude (either
very positive or very negative), the derivative approaches zero. For example:

- When x = 6, σ(x) ≈ 0.998, so σ'(x) ≈ 0.002
- When x = -6, σ(x) ≈ 0.002, so σ'(x) ≈ 0.002

This property leads to the "vanishing gradient problem." When inputs fall in regions where the derivative is nearly
zero, the error signal during backpropagation becomes extremely small, effectively stopping the network from learning.
This problem becomes particularly severe in deep networks where these tiny gradients are multiplied across many layers,
essentially reducing the gradient to zero before it reaches the early layers.

Despite this limitation, the sigmoid function still finds use in specific contexts:

- In the output layer of binary classification models, where its 0-1 range naturally represents probabilities
- In certain gating mechanisms of recurrent neural networks like LSTMs and GRUs
- In scenarios where a probability interpretation of activation is needed

##### ReLU and its Variants

The Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) has revolutionized deep learning by addressing many of the problems associated with
traditional sigmoid and tanh activations. Its extraordinary simplicity belies its effectiveness.

The ReLU function is defined as:

$$\text{ReLU}(x) = \max(0, x)$$

In plain language, ReLU outputs the input directly if it's positive, and zero otherwise. This piecewise linear function
looks like a bent line—flat at zero for all negative inputs, and then climbing with slope 1 for all positive inputs.

Despite (or perhaps because of) its simplicity, ReLU offers several significant advantages:

1. **Computational efficiency**: ReLU involves only a simple comparison and selection operation—much faster to compute
   than the exponential operations in sigmoid or tanh. This efficiency becomes crucial when training large networks.
2. **Sparsity promotion**: By zeroing out negative inputs, ReLU naturally creates sparse activations—many neurons output
   exactly zero. Approximately 50% of neurons are not activated (assuming inputs are centered around zero), which can
   help with:
    - More efficient computation
    - Better feature disentanglement
    - Noise resistance
3. **Reduced vanishing gradient problem**: For all positive inputs, ReLU's derivative is exactly 1, allowing gradients
   to flow without attenuation. This property helps deep networks learn more effectively.

The derivative of ReLU is straightforward:

$$\text{ReLU}'(x) = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } x > 0 \\ 0 & \text{if } x < 0 \ \text{undefined} & \text{if } x = 0 \end{cases}$$

In practice, the derivative at x = 0 is typically defined as either 0 or 1, though this point has measure zero (occurs
with probability zero for continuous inputs), so its exact value rarely matters.

Despite its advantages, ReLU suffers from a significant limitation known as the "dying ReLU problem." If, during
training, a neuron's weights are updated such that its weighted sum becomes consistently negative, that neuron will
always output zero—and more critically, its gradient will also be zero, preventing any further updates. This neuron has
effectively "died" and becomes useless for learning.

To address this issue, several ReLU variants have been developed:

1. **Leaky ReLU**: Allows a small positive slope for negative inputs, preventing neurons from dying completely.

    $$\begin{align}&\text{LeakyReLU}(x) = \begin{cases} x & \text{if } x > 0 \\ \alpha x & \text{if } x \leq 0 \end{cases}\end{align}$$

    where α is a small constant, typically 0.01. This small slope ensures that neurons still receive a gradient even for
    negative inputs.

2. **Parametric ReLU (PReLU)**: Similar to Leaky ReLU, but treats the negative slope α as a learnable parameter rather
   than a fixed constant. This allows the network to determine the optimal negative slope during training.

3. **Exponential Linear Unit (ELU)**:

    $$\text{ELU}(x) = \begin{cases} x & \text{if } x > 0 \\ \alpha(e^x - 1) & \text{if } x \leq 0 \end{cases}$$

    ELU usesan exponential function for negative inputs, which creates a smooth transition at x = 0 and saturates for
    highly negative inputs. This helps reduce the shift in mean activation toward the positive side (which can slow down
    learning).

4. **Scaled Exponential Linear Unit (SELU)**: A self-normalizing variant of ELU designed to automatically maintain
   activations with zero mean and unit variance across network layers. This property helps training deep networks by
   preventing exploding or vanishing gradients.

5. **Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU)**: Approximates x · Φ(x) where Φ(x) is the standard normal cumulative
   distribution function. GELU can be viewed as a smooth interpolation between ReLU and Leaky ReLU that has shown strong
   performance in modern transformer architectures.

To visualize how these functions differ, imagine four inputs: -2, -0.5, 0, and 2:

- ReLU: [0, 0, 0, 2]
- Leaky ReLU (α=0.01): [-0.02, -0.005, 0, 2]
- ELU (α=1): [-0.86, -0.39, 0, 2]
- GELU: [-0.04, -0.15, 0, 1.95]

These variants aim to preserve ReLU's benefits while addressing its limitations. The choice among them often depends on
the specific application, with ReLU still serving as a strong default due to its simplicity and effectiveness.

##### Hyperbolic Tangent (tanh)

The hyperbolic tangent, or tanh function, is another sigmoidal activation function that maps inputs to outputs in the
range (-1, 1). Unlike the standard sigmoid which ranges from 0 to 1, tanh is zero-centered, which offers important
advantages for neural network training.

The tanh function is defined as:

$$\tanh(x) = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{e^x + e^{-x}}$$

Visually, tanh creates an S-shaped curve similar to the sigmoid, but stretched vertically to range from -1 to 1 instead
of 0 to 1. In fact, there's a direct relationship between sigmoid and tanh:

$$\tanh(x) = 2\sigma(2x) - 1$$

This shows that tanh is essentially a rescaled and shifted version of the sigmoid function.

Let's examine the key properties of tanh:

1. **Bounded output (-1 to 1)**: Like sigmoid, tanh squashes inputs to a finite range, but centered at zero:

    - When x = 0, tanh(x) = 0
    - As x approaches +∞, tanh(x) approaches +1
    - As x approaches -∞, tanh(x) approaches -1

2. **Zero-centered outputs**: This is perhaps the most significant advantage over the standard sigmoid. With outputs
   centered around zero, the average activation tends to be closer to zero, which helps with the learning dynamics of
   the network.

    To understand why this matters, consider a neuron in the next layer receiving these activations as inputs. If all
    inputs are positive (as with sigmoid), all weight updates for that neuron will be either all positive or all
    negative, forcing the optimization to take a zigzag path. Zero-centered activations allow for more direct paths to
    the optimum.

3. **Stronger gradients**: The derivative of tanh reaches a maximum value of 1 (at x = 0), whereas the maximum
   derivative of sigmoid is only 0.25. This generally allows for faster learning with tanh.

The derivative of tanh can also be expressed in terms of the function itself:

$$\tanh'(x) = 1 - \tanh^2(x)$$

This can be derived as follows:

Starting with: $\tanh(x) = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{e^x + e^{-x}}$

Taking the derivative: $\tanh'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{e^x + e^{-x}}\right)$

Using the quotient rule:
$\tanh'(x) = \frac{(e^x + e^{-x})(e^x + e^{-x}) - (e^x - e^{-x})(e^x - e^{-x})}{(e^x + e^{-x})^2}$

Simplifying: $\tanh'(x) = \frac{(e^x + e^{-x})^2 - (e^x - e^{-x})^2}{(e^x + e^{-x})^2}$

$\tanh'(x) = 1 - \frac{(e^x - e^{-x})^2}{(e^x + e^{-x})^2}$

$\tanh'(x) = 1 - \tanh^2(x)$

Like the sigmoid, tanh also suffers from the vanishing gradient problem for inputs with large absolute values. When x
has a large magnitude, tanh(x) approaches either 1 or -1, causing the derivative to approach zero. This can slow down
learning in deep networks.

Historically, tanh was often preferred over sigmoid for hidden layers due to its zero-centered nature and stronger
gradients. In modern deep learning, however, ReLU and its variants have largely replaced tanh, except in specific
architectures:

- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Tanh is still commonly used in traditional RNNs and as part of the gating mechanisms
  in LSTMs and GRUs
- Certain initialization schemes that work well with bounded, zero-centered activations
- Networks where bounded outputs are desirable for stability reasons

The choice between sigmoid, tanh, and ReLU often depends on the specific requirements of the neural network architecture
and the nature of the problem being solved.

##### Softmax for Multi-Class Problems

While sigmoid and tanh work well for binary problems or activating individual neurons, multi-class classification
requires a different approach. The softmax function elegantly extends the concept of the sigmoid to handle multiple
classes by converting a vector of real numbers into a probability distribution.

For an input vector $\mathbf{z} = (z_1, z_2, ..., z_K)$, the softmax function is defined as:

$$\text{softmax}(z_i) = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^{K} e^{z_j}}$$

The function takes a vector of K real numbers (often called "logits") and transforms them into K probability values that
sum to 1. Each output value represents the probability of the corresponding class.

To build intuition, let's work through an example:

Imagine we have raw outputs from a neural network trying to classify an image as either a cat, dog, or bird: z = [2.0,
1.0, 0.1]

To convert these to probabilities using softmax:

1. Calculate the exponentials: e^2.0 ≈ 7.39, e^1.0 ≈ 2.72, e^0.1 ≈ 1.11
2. Sum the exponentials: 7.39 + 2.72 + 1.11 ≈ 11.22
3. Divide each exponential by the sum:
    - P(cat) = 7.39/11.22 ≈ 0.66 or 66%
    - P(dog) = 2.72/11.22 ≈ 0.24 or 24%
    - P(bird) = 1.11/11.22 ≈ 0.10 or 10%

This gives us a probability distribution across the three classes that sums to 1, with the highest probability correctly
assigned to the class with the highest initial score.

The softmax function has several important properties that make it ideal for multi-class classification:

1. **Normalization**: The outputs always sum to 1, forming a valid probability distribution. This enables probabilistic
   interpretations of network outputs.
2. **Positive outputs**: All outputs are strictly positive, regardless of the input values. This ensures that every
   class receives some probability, however small.
3. **Relative scale preservation**: The softmax preserves the ordering of inputs—higher input values correspond to
   higher output probabilities. The class with the highest score will always have the highest probability.
4. **Competition mechanism**: An increase in one class's score affects all other classes' probabilities, creating a
   competitive dynamic where classes "compete" for probability mass. This matches the intuition of classification
   problems where assigning higher confidence to one class should reduce confidence in others.
5. **Differentiability**: The softmax function is differentiable everywhere, making it suitable for gradient-based
   optimization.

The derivative of the softmax function is more complex than our previous activation functions because changing one input
affects all outputs (due to the normalization). The derivative takes the form:

$$\frac{\partial \text{softmax}(z_i)}{\partial z_j} = \begin{cases} \text{softmax}(z_i)(1 - \text{softmax}(z_i)) & \text{if } i = j \\ -\text{softmax}(z_i)\text{softmax}(z_j) & \text{if } i \neq j \end{cases}$$

Despite this seemingly complex form, when combined with cross-entropy loss (as is typically done in classification
tasks), the gradient simplifies beautifully to:

$$\frac{\partial \text{CrossEntropy}}{\partial z_i} = \text{softmax}(z_i) - y_i$$

Where $y_i$ is 1 if class i is the correct class and 0 otherwise. This simple gradient form makes softmax with
cross-entropy particularly effective for classification tasks.

An important practical consideration when implementing softmax is numerical stability. Direct computation can lead to
numerical overflow when exponentiating large values. A common technique to improve stability is to subtract the maximum
value from all inputs before exponentiation:

$$\text{softmax}(z_i) = \frac{e^{z_i - \max_j z_j}}{\sum_{j=1}^{K} e^{z_j - \max_j z_j}}$$

This produces identical results (since the exponential is invariant to constant shifts) but avoids numerical issues.

Softmax is typically used in the output layer of neural networks for multi-class classification problems. It transforms
raw network outputs into interpretable probabilities that can be directly used for decision-making or further
probabilistic modeling.

##### Activation Function Selection Criteria

Choosing the right activation function is a crucial decision in neural network design that can significantly impact
training dynamics, model performance, and computational efficiency. Several factors guide this selection process:

1. **Nature of the problem**:

    The type of task you're solving often dictates the activation function in your output layer:

    - For binary classification: Sigmoid is natural since it outputs values between 0 and 1, which can be interpreted as
      probabilities.
    - For multi-class classification: Softmax is the standard choice as it produces a probability distribution across
      all classes.
    - For regression problems: Linear activation (or no activation) is typically used to allow the network to predict
      any real value.

    For hidden layers, ReLU and its variants have become the default for most applications, but other considerations may
    apply.

2. **Gradient flow considerations**:

    The flow of gradients through your network is critical for effective learning:

    - Sigmoid and tanh can cause vanishing gradients in deep networks because their derivatives approach zero for inputs
      with large magnitudes.
    - ReLU allows strong gradient flow for positive inputs (derivative = 1) but suffers from "dying neurons" for
      consistently negative inputs (derivative = 0).
    - Leaky variants of ReLU help maintain some gradient flow even for negative inputs.
    - ELU and SELU provide smoother gradient transitions near zero while still addressing vanishing gradients.

    For very deep networks, maintaining gradient flow becomes increasingly important, favoring activations like ReLU
    variants.

3. **Computational efficiency**:

    Training large models requires considering computational costs:

    - ReLU requires only a simple max operation, making it extremely efficient.
    - Sigmoid and tanh involve expensive exponential computations.
    - More complex functions like ELU or GELU incur additional computational overhead.

    On modern hardware optimized for deep learning, these differences may be less significant, but they can matter when
    deploying models on resource-constrained devices.

4. **Network depth and architecture**:

    Different network architectures have different activation requirements:

    - Very deep networks typically perform better with ReLU and its variants due to better gradient flow.
    - Residual networks (ResNets) often use ReLU successfully due to their skip connections that help gradient flow.
    - Self-normalizing networks benefit from SELU, which is designed to maintain activation statistics across layers.
    - Recurrent architectures often use tanh and sigmoid for gating mechanisms due to their bounded ranges.
    - Transformer architectures have shown strong performance with GELU activations.

5. **Regularization effects**:

    Activation functions can have implicit regularization effects:

    - ReLU creates sparse activations (many exact zeros), which can have a regularizing effect similar to dropout.
    - Leaky variants reduce this sparsity but improve gradient flow.
    - Functions like GELU and Swish have been shown to provide slight regularization benefits in some contexts.

6. **Domain-specific considerations**:

    Some domains have established practices:

    - Computer vision models typically use ReLU or its variants in convolutional neural networks.
    - Natural language processing models increasingly use GELU, especially in transformer architectures.
    - Time series models might benefit from tanh's bounded range for stability.

7. **Empirical performance**:

    Ultimately, the most convincing argument for an activation function is empirical success:

    - ReLU revolutionized deep learning by enabling the training of much deeper networks than was previously possible.
    - GELU has shown strong performance in transformer models like BERT and GPT.
    - Swish (x·sigmoid(βx)) demonstrated improvements over ReLU in image classification tasks.
    - For your specific problem, empirical testing on validation data often provides the most reliable guidance.

Modern research continues to develop new activation functions that aim to combine the best properties of existing ones
while addressing their limitations. Some recent innovations include:

- **Swish**: $$f(x) = x · σ(βx)$$ where β is a trainable parameter or fixed constant. Swish resembles ReLU but with a
  smooth transition that allows small negative values to pass through.
- **Mish**: $$f(x) = x · tanh(ln(1 + e^x))$$. Similar to Swish but with some theoretical advantages in terms of
  smoothness and boundedness of derivatives.
- **GELU**: $$f(x) = x · Φ(x)$$ where Φ is the standard normal CDF. Now widely used in transformer models like BERT and
  GPT.

A practical approach to selecting activation functions is to:

1. Start with default choices based on the task type (ReLU for hidden layers, appropriate output activation for your
   task).
2. If you encounter issues like dying neurons, try variants like Leaky ReLU or ELU.
3. For very deep networks, consider activations designed for depth like SELU.
4. Benchmark several options on your validation data if performance is critical.
5. Consider computational constraints for your deployment environment.

Remember that different layers in your network can use different activation functions if there's a good reason for it.
While consistency is often desirable for simplicity, mixed activation strategies can sometimes yield better results.

#### Multi-Class Classification

Multi-class classification extends our ability to categorize data beyond simple binary decisions into scenarios with
three or more distinct categories. This fundamental capability enables computers to tackle many real-world problems,
from recognizing different objects in images to diagnosing various medical conditions to categorizing documents into
multiple topics.

##### One-Hot Encoding Implementation

One-hot encoding transforms categorical variables into a format that machine learning algorithms can work with
effectively. It's called "one-hot" because exactly one element in the resulting vector is "hot" (set to 1) while all
others are "cold" (set to 0).

To understand why we need one-hot encoding, consider the challenge of representing categories like "Apple," "Banana,"
and "Cherry." We could assign them numeric values 1, 2, and 3, but this would mislead our algorithms into thinking
there's an inherent ordering (that Banana is somehow "between" Apple and Cherry) and that the differences between
categories are uniform. One-hot encoding solves this problem by representing each category as its own dimension in a
vector space.

Let's see how one-hot encoding works with a concrete example. Imagine we have fruit categories [Apple, Banana, Cherry].
Using one-hot encoding, we'd represent them as:

- Apple → [1, 0, 0]
- Banana → [0, 1, 0]
- Cherry → [0, 0, 1]

Mathematically, for a category $c$ from a set of $K$ possible categories, the one-hot encoded vector $y$ is defined as:

$$y_i = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } i = c \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$

for $i = 1, 2, ..., K$.

One-hot encoding creates several important properties that benefit machine learning algorithms:

1. **Equidistance**: In the resulting vector space, all categories are equally distant from each other. The Euclidean
   distance between any two one-hot vectors is exactly $\sqrt{2}$, reflecting that all categories are equally different
   from one another with no implicit hierarchy.
2. **Orthogonality**: One-hot vectors are perpendicular to each other in the geometric sense (their dot product is
   zero). This orthogonality helps learning algorithms clearly distinguish between categories.
3. **Compatibility with neural networks**: One-hot vectors work naturally with the softmax activation function and
   cross-entropy loss commonly used in neural networks for classification tasks.

There are several ways to implement one-hot encoding, depending on your programming environment and needs:

Using a simple function:

```python
def one_hot_encode(category_index, num_categories):
    encoding = [0] * num_categories
    encoding[category_index] = 1
    return encoding

# Example usage
apple_encoding = one_hot_encode(0, 3)  # [1, 0, 0]
banana_encoding = one_hot_encode(1, 3)  # [0, 1, 0]
```

Using libraries like scikit-learn:

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder

# Input data: category indices as column vectors
data = [[0], [1], [2]]  # Apple, Banana, Cherry

# Initialize and fit the encoder
encoder = OneHotEncoder(sparse=False)
encoded_data = encoder.fit_transform(data)

# Result:
# [[1. 0. 0.]
#  [0. 1. 0.]
#  [0. 0. 1.]]
```

Using NumPy for efficient processing:

```python
import numpy as np

# For a single category
category_index = 1  # Banana
encoding = np.zeros(3)
encoding[category_index] = 1  # [0, 1, 0]

# For multiple categories at once
indices = [0, 2, 1]  # Apple, Cherry, Banana
encodings = np.eye(3)[indices]
# Result:
# [[1, 0, 0]
#  [0, 0, 1]
#  [0, 1, 0]]
```

While one-hot encoding is powerful, it does have limitations, particularly when dealing with many categories. For
instance, if you're encoding words from a vocabulary of 50,000 terms, each word becomes a very sparse 50,000-dimensional
vector with just one non-zero element. This "curse of dimensionality" can lead to computational inefficiency and
overfitting.

To address this issue in practice, several alternatives exist:

- **Embedding layers** in neural networks, which learn dense, lower-dimensional representations of categories
- **Feature hashing** techniques that map categories to a fixed-size vector space using hash functions
- **Target encoding** methods that replace categorical values with statistics derived from the target variable

For most multi-class classification problems with a reasonable number of classes, one-hot encoding remains the standard
approach due to its simplicity and effectiveness.

##### Softmax Function Application

The softmax function transforms raw model outputs into a probability distribution across multiple classes, making it a
cornerstone of multi-class classification in neural networks. It helps us interpret what the network "thinks" about an
input by assigning probabilities to each possible category.

Mathematically, for an input vector $\mathbf{z} = (z_1, z_2, ..., z_K)$ containing the raw scores (logits) for each
class, the softmax function computes:

$$\text{softmax}(z_i) = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^{K} e^{z_j}}$$

To develop a deeper understanding, let's walk through how softmax works in a practical neural network context:

Imagine we're building a system to classify handwritten digits (0-9). Our neural network processes an image and outputs
ten values, one for each digit. These raw outputs might look like:

```math
&z = [-2.85, 0.86, 3.44, -0.34, -1.86, 0.10, -2.54, 0.21, 2.67, -1.13]\\
```

These raw scores don't have a clear interpretation—they're not probabilities, percentages, or any other intuitive
measure. That's where softmax comes in.

The softmax function works in three steps:

1. **Exponentiate all values**: Calculate e^z for each element

    ```math
    &e^z = [0.058, 2.363, 31.191, 0.712, 0.156, 1.105, 0.079, 1.234, 14.440, 0.323]\\
    ```

2. **Sum all exponentials**: Calculate the denominator for normalization

    ```math
    &sum(e^z) = 51.661\\
    ```

3. **Divide each exponential by the sum**: This ensures the results sum to 1

    ```math
    &softmax(z) = [0.001, 0.046, 0.604, 0.014, 0.003, 0.021, 0.002, 0.024, 0.280, 0.006]\\
    ```

Now we have a proper probability distribution! The network is indicating it's 60.4% confident the image is a "2", with
"8" as the second most likely digit at 28.0%. All probabilities sum to 1 (or very close to 1, allowing for small
rounding errors).

The softmax function has several important properties that make it ideal for multi-class classification:

1. **Probabilistic output**: It produces values between 0 and 1 that sum to exactly 1, giving us a valid probability
   distribution.
2. **Differentiable**: It has well-defined derivatives everywhere, making it compatible with gradient-based optimization
   methods like backpropagation.
3. **Preserves ranking**: The class with the highest raw score will also have the highest probability after softmax. If
   z₂ > z₈ in the raw scores, then softmax(z₂) > softmax(z₈) in the probabilities.
4. **Emphasizes differences**: The exponential function amplifies differences between values. If one raw score is
   slightly higher than others, its probability after softmax can be substantially higher.

One practical challenge when implementing softmax is numerical stability. The exponential function can quickly lead to
overflow for large inputs or underflow for very negative inputs. A common trick to address this is to subtract the
maximum value from all inputs before applying softmax:

$$\text{softmax}(z_i) = \frac{e^{z_i - \max_j z_j}}{\sum_{j=1}^{K} e^{z_j - \max_j z_j}}$$

This produces mathematically equivalent results but avoids numerical issues. In our example:

```math
\begin{align}
&z_{\text{shifted}} = z - max(z) = [-6.29, -2.58, 0.00, -3.78, -5.30, -3.34, -5.98, -3.23, -0.77, -4.57]\\
&e^z_{\text{shifted}} = [0.002, 0.076, 1.000, 0.023, 0.005, 0.035, 0.003, 0.040, 0.463, 0.010]\\
&sum(e^z_{\text{shifted}}) = 1.657\\
&softmax(z) = [0.001, 0.046, 0.604, 0.014, 0.003, 0.021, 0.002, 0.024, 0.280, 0.006]\\
\end{align}
```

We get the same result, but without risking numerical overflow.

In practice, many deep learning frameworks combine softmax with cross-entropy loss in a single operation for both
efficiency and numerical stability:

```python
# PyTorch example
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Raw logits from the network
logits = torch.tensor([[-2.85, 0.86, 3.44, -0.34, -1.86, 0.10, -2.54, 0.21, 2.67, -1.13]])

# True label (class 2)
labels = torch.tensor([2])

# Separate softmax and cross-entropy (less efficient)
probabilities = torch.softmax(logits, dim=1)
loss_fn = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
loss = loss_fn(probabilities, labels)

# Combined operation (more efficient and numerically stable)
direct_loss = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()(logits, labels)  # Applies softmax internally
```

The softmax function is typically used in the output layer of neural networks for multi-class classification. It
transforms the network's raw outputs into interpretable probabilities that guide decision-making and provide insight
into the model's confidence levels across different classes.

##### Multi-Class Loss Functions

Loss functions for multi-class classification measure how well your model's predictions match the true labels. They
provide the learning signal that guides the optimization process, making their choice critical for effective model
training. Several loss functions are commonly used for multi-class problems, each with distinct properties and use
cases.

**Categorical Cross-Entropy (Multi-class Cross-Entropy)**

This is the most widely used loss function for multi-class classification with softmax outputs. It measures the
dissimilarity between the predicted probability distribution and the true distribution (typically represented as one-hot
encoded vectors).

For a single training example, categorical cross-entropy is defined as:

$$L_{CE} = -\sum_{i=1}^{K} y_i \log(p_i)$$

Where:

- $K$ is the number of classes
- $y_i$ is the true label (1 for the correct class, 0 for others)
- $p_i$ is the predicted probability for class $i$

To understand this intuitively, let's work through an example. Imagine we're classifying an image that is actually a cat
(class 0), with other possibilities being dog (class 1) and bird (class 2). The true label as a one-hot vector would be
[1, 0, 0].

Scenario 1: Our model makes a confident, correct prediction with probabilities [0.9, 0.05, 0.05]
$$L_{CE} = -(1 \times \log(0.9) + 0 \times \log(0.05) + 0 \times \log(0.05)) = -\log(0.9) \approx 0.105$$

Scenario 2: Our model makes an uncertain prediction with probabilities [0.4, 0.3, 0.3]
$$L_{CE} = -(1 \times \log(0.4) + 0 \times \log(0.3) + 0 \times \log(0.3)) = -\log(0.4) \approx 0.916$$

Scenario 3: Our model makes a confident, incorrect prediction with probabilities [0.1, 0.8, 0.1]
$$L_{CE} = -(1 \times \log(0.1) + 0 \times \log(0.8) + 0 \times \log(0.1)) = -\log(0.1) \approx 2.303$$

This illustrates how cross-entropy harshly penalizes confident incorrect predictions while being more lenient with
uncertain predictions. When the model assigns a probability near zero to the correct class, the loss approaches
infinity, creating a strong learning signal.

For a dataset of $N$ samples, the loss is typically averaged:

$$L_{CE} = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{j=1}^{N} \sum_{i=1}^{K} y_{ji} \log(p_{ji})$$

Since one-hot vectors have only one non-zero element, this simplifies to:

$$L_{CE} = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{j=1}^{N} \log(p_{j,c_j})$$

where $c_j$ is the correct class for sample $j$.

The gradient of this loss with respect to the logits has a remarkably simple form:

$$\frac{\partial L_{CE}}{\partial z_i} = p_i - y_i$$

This elegant gradient makes categorical cross-entropy particularly effective for training neural networks. The update
signal is simply the difference between the predicted probability and the target probability for each class.

**Sparse Categorical Cross-Entropy**

This loss function is functionally equivalent to categorical cross-entropy but takes class indices rather than one-hot
encoded vectors as labels. For large numbers of classes, this saves memory and computation:

$$L_{SCE} = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{j=1}^{N} \log(p_{j,c_j})$$

where $c_j$ is the index of the correct class for sample $j$. Instead of working with large one-hot vectors, we only
need to store and process a single integer per sample.

In frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch, you might use sparse categorical cross-entropy like this:

```python
# TensorFlow example
import tensorflow as tf

# With one-hot labels
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam')

# With class indices
model.compile(loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam')
```

**Kullback-Leibler Divergence**

KL divergence measures how one probability distribution diverges from another:

$$L_{KL} = \sum_{i=1}^{K} y_i \log\left(\frac{y_i}{p_i}\right)$$

For classification with one-hot encoded targets, KL divergence differs from cross-entropy only by a constant (the
entropy of the target distribution). Since this constant doesn't affect optimization, minimizing KL divergence or
cross-entropy leads to the same model parameters.

However, KL divergence becomes particularly useful when the targets are "soft probabilities" rather than hard 0/1
values, such as in knowledge distillation where a smaller model learns from the probability outputs of a larger model.

**Focal Loss**

Focal loss was introduced to address class imbalance problems by down-weighting easy examples to focus training on hard
cases:

$$L_{FL} = -\sum_{i=1}^{K} \alpha_i y_i (1-p_i)^\gamma \log(p_i)$$

where:

- $\alpha_i$ is a weighting factor for class $i$ (often set based on class frequency)
- $\gamma$ is the focusing parameter (typically 2) that reduces the relative loss for well-classified examples

The $(1-p_i)^\gamma$ term causes the loss to focus on examples where the model is less confident in the correct class.
When the model is very confident ($p_i$ close to 1), this term becomes small, reducing the loss contribution.

Consider our earlier example with a cat image:

With standard cross-entropy (γ=0) and a prediction of [0.9, 0.05, 0.05]: $$L_{CE} = -\log(0.9) \approx 0.105$$

With focal loss (γ=2) and the same prediction: $$L_{FL} = -(1-0.9)^2 \times \log(0.9) \approx 0.001$$

The focal loss is much smaller because this is an "easy" example where the model already makes a confident correct
prediction. This allows the training to focus more on difficult examples where improvement is needed.

**Label Smoothing**

Label smoothing is a regularization technique that replaces hard 0/1 labels with soft targets:

$$y'_i = \begin{cases} 1-\epsilon+\epsilon/K & \text{if } i \text{ is the correct class} \ \epsilon/K & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$

where $\epsilon$ is the smoothing parameter (typically a small value like 0.1).

For a 3-class problem with true class 0, standard one-hot encoding would give [1, 0, 0]. With label smoothing
($\epsilon=0.1$), we'd get [0.933, 0.033, 0.033].

This prevents the model from becoming too confident and improves generalization by:

1. Discouraging the model from assigning probabilities too close to 0 or 1
2. Introducing uncertainty that reflects the inherent ambiguity in many classification tasks
3. Making the model more robust to label noise

Each of these loss functions serves specific purposes in multi-class classification. The standard categorical
cross-entropy remains the most widely used due to its solid theoretical foundation and effectiveness in practice, but
specialized variants can be valuable for addressing specific challenges like class imbalance or overfitting.

##### Decision Boundaries in Higher Dimensions

Decision boundaries in multi-class classification define where the predicted class changes from one category to another.
Understanding these boundaries helps us visualize how our model partitions the feature space and gain insights into its
behavior.

In binary classification, the decision boundary is a single hypersurface, but multi-class classification involves
multiple boundaries that collectively partition the feature space into regions corresponding to different classes.

Let's start with a simple case: For a neural network with softmax output, the decision boundary between classes $i$ and
$j$ occurs at points where their probabilities are equal:

$$p_i = p_j$$

Substituting the softmax formula:

$$\frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_{k=1}^{K} e^{z_k}} = \frac{e^{z_j}}{\sum_{k=1}^{K} e^{z_k}}$$

Since the denominators are identical, this simplifies to:

$$e^{z_i} = e^{z_j}$$

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

$$z_i = z_j$$

This tells us something profound: the decision boundary between any two classes depends only on the equality of their
logits, not on the values of other classes' logits.

In a neural network, each logit $z_i$ is typically computed as a linear function of the final hidden layer output
$\mathbf{h}$:

$$z_i = \mathbf{w}_i \cdot \mathbf{h} + b_i$$

Where $\mathbf{w}_i$ is the weight vector for class $i$ and $b_i$ is the bias term.

Thus, the decision boundary between classes $i$ and $j$ is given by:

$$\mathbf{w}_i \cdot \mathbf{h} + b_i = \mathbf{w}_j \cdot \mathbf{h} + b_j$$
$$(\mathbf{w}_i - \mathbf{w}_j) \cdot \mathbf{h} + (b_i - b_j) = 0$$

This is the equation of a hyperplane in the space of the final hidden layer outputs.

To visualize this, imagine a 2D feature space with three classes: red, green, and blue. Each pair of classes creates a
boundary line:

- Red vs. Green boundary:
  $(\mathbf{w}*{\text{red}} - \mathbf{w}*{\text{green}}) \cdot \mathbf{h} + (b_{\text{red}} - b_{\text{green}}) = 0$
- Red vs. Blue boundary:
  $(\mathbf{w}*{\text{red}} - \mathbf{w}*{\text{blue}}) \cdot \mathbf{h} + (b_{\text{red}} - b_{\text{blue}}) = 0$
- Green vs. Blue boundary:
  $(\mathbf{w}*{\text{green}} - \mathbf{w}*{\text{blue}}) \cdot \mathbf{h} + (b_{\text{green}} - b_{\text{blue}}) = 0$

These three lines partition the space into regions where each class has the highest probability. The boundaries meet at
points where all three classes have equal probabilities.

For a $K$-class problem, there are potentially $\binom{K}{2} = \frac{K(K-1)}{2}$ such boundaries. With 10 classes, this
means up to 45 distinct boundary hyperplanes!

The complexity of these decision boundaries depends on the network architecture:

1. **Linear model**: Produces linear decision boundaries directly in the input space, creating a piecewise linear
   partition of the space (like a Voronoi diagram).
2. **Single hidden layer**: Can create non-linear decision boundaries. Each neuron in the hidden layer can be viewed as
   creating a hyperplane in the input space. The output layer then combines these hyperplanes to form more complex
   boundaries.
3. **Deep networks**: Can form highly complex, non-linear decision boundaries by hierarchically transforming the input
   space. Early layers detect simple patterns, and deeper layers combine these patterns to form intricate decision
   regions.

In high-dimensional spaces, visualizing these boundaries becomes challenging. Several techniques help us understand
them:

1. **Dimension reduction**: Methods like PCA, t-SNE, or UMAP can project high-dimensional data onto 2D or 3D spaces for
   visualization. While this loses some information, it can reveal the overall structure of the decision regions.
2. **Pairwise boundary plots**: We can fix all but two features at their mean or median values and plot the decision
   boundaries in the remaining 2D space. By creating multiple such plots for different feature pairs, we gain insight
   into how different features influence classification.
3. **Decision boundary meshes**: For 2D or 3D feature spaces, we can create a grid of points, predict the class for each
   point, and color the resulting mesh to visualize the decision regions.

Here's how we might visualize decision boundaries in a 2D space with a trained classifier:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier

# Train a model (simplified example)
model = MLPClassifier(hidden_layer_sizes=(10,), max_iter=1000)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Create a mesh grid
x_min, x_max = X[:, 0].min() - 1, X[:, 0].max() + 1
y_min, y_max = X[:, 1].min() - 1, X[:, 1].max() + 1
xx, yy = np.meshgrid(np.arange(x_min, x_max, 0.02),
                     np.arange(y_min, y_max, 0.02))

# Predict class for each point in the mesh
Z = model.predict(np.c_[xx.ravel(), yy.ravel()])
Z = Z.reshape(xx.shape)

# Plot the decision boundary
plt.contourf(xx, yy, Z, alpha=0.8)
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=y, edgecolors='k')
plt.xlabel('Feature 1')
plt.ylabel('Feature 2')
plt.title('Decision Boundaries')
plt.show()
```

Understanding these decision boundaries helps us:

- Interpret how the model makes decisions
- Identify regions where the model might be uncertain (near boundaries)
- Detect potential biases in classification
- Generate synthetic examples to improve model performance (e.g., by focusing on boundary regions)
- Compare different models based on the boundaries they create

As the dimensionality of your feature space increases, the geometry becomes increasingly complex and counter-intuitive,
making visualization tools even more valuable for understanding model behavior.

##### Performance Evaluation Metrics

Proper evaluation metrics are essential for assessing the performance of multi-class classification models. Different
metrics reveal different aspects of model performance, and choosing the right ones depends on your specific application
needs.

**Accuracy**

Accuracy is the most intuitive metric, measuring the proportion of correctly classified instances:

$$\text{Accuracy} = \frac{\text{Number of correct predictions}}{\text{Total number of predictions}}$$

While easy to understand, accuracy can be misleading with imbalanced classes. If 95% of your data belongs to one class,
a model that always predicts that class would achieve 95% accuracy without learning anything useful about the minority
classes.

**Confusion Matrix**

The confusion matrix provides a detailed breakdown of predictions versus actual classes. For a $K$-class problem, it's a
$K \times K$ table where:

- Rows represent the true classes
- Columns represent the predicted classes
- Each cell $(i,j)$ shows how many instances of true class $i$ were predicted as class $j$

For example, a confusion matrix for a 3-class problem might look like:

|              | Predicted A | Predicted B | Predicted C |
| ------------ | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| **Actual A** | 45          | 3           | 2           |
| **Actual B** | 5           | 38          | 7           |
| **Actual C** | 1           | 4           | 35          |

Reading this matrix:

- 45 instances of class A were correctly classified as A
- 3 instances of class A were misclassified as B
- 2 instances of class A were misclassified as C
- And so on...

The confusion matrix reveals the specific types of errors the model makes. In this example, the model confuses classes B
and C more often than A and C, which might suggest that B and C have more similar features.

**Precision, Recall, and F1 Score**

These metrics can be calculated for each class in a one-vs-rest manner:

For class $i$:

- **Precision**: The proportion of positive predictions that are correct.
  $$\text{Precision}_i = \frac{\text{TP}_i}{\text{TP}_i + \text{FP}_i}$$ Where TP₁ is true positives (correctly
  predicted class i) and FP₁ is false positives (incorrectly predicted as class i).

    Precision answers: "Of all instances predicted as class i, what percentage actually belongs to class i?"

    Low precision indicates many false positives—the model is too liberal in assigning this class.

- **Recall (Sensitivity)**: The proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified.
  $$\text{Recall}_i = \frac{\text{TP}_i}{\text{TP}_i + \text{FN}_i}$$ Where FN₁ is false negatives (class i instances
  predicted as something else).

    Recall answers: "Of all instances actually belonging to class i, what percentage was correctly identified?"

    Low recall indicates many false negatives—the model is missing instances of this class.

- **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
  $$\text{F1}_i = 2 \cdot \frac{\text{Precision}_i \cdot \text{Recall}_i}{\text{Precision}_i + \text{Recall}_i}$$

    F1 provides a balance between precision and recall. The harmonic mean heavily penalizes extreme values, so a good F1
    score requires both reasonable precision and recall.

These per-class metrics need to be aggregated for multi-class problems. Common approaches include:

1. **Macro-averaging**: Calculate metrics for each class independently and then average them, giving equal weight to
   each class regardless of size. $$\text{Precision}*{\text{macro}} = \frac{1}{K}\sum*{i=1}^{K} \text{Precision}_i$$

    This approach treats all classes as equally important, which is useful when you care about performance across all
    classes equally, even rare ones.

2. **Weighted averaging**: Similar to macro-averaging, but weights each class's contribution by its frequency in the
   dataset. $$\text{Precision}*{\text{weighted}} = \frac{1}{N}\sum*{i=1}^{K} N_i \cdot \text{Precision}_i$$ Where N₁ is
   the number of instances of class i and N is the total number of instances.

    This gives a more representative overall metric when class sizes vary significantly.

3. **Micro-averaging**: Aggregate the contributions of all classes to compute the average metric.
   $$\text{Precision}*{\text{micro}} = \frac{\sum*{i=1}^{K} \text{TP}*i}{\sum*{i=1}^{K} (\text{TP}_i + \text{FP}_i)}$$

    Micro-averaging calculates metrics using summed counts, effectively giving more weight to classes with more
    instances.

**Cohen's Kappa**

Cohen's Kappa measures agreement between the classifier and the true labels, corrected for agreement by chance:

$$\kappa = \frac{p_o - p_e}{1 - p_e}$$

Where:

- $p_o$ is the observed agreement ratio (accuracy)
- $p_e$ is the expected agreement by chance (if the classifier and true labels were independent)

Kappa values range from -1 to 1:

- 1 indicates perfect agreement
- 0 suggests agreement no better than random chance
- Negative values indicate worse than random agreement

Kappa is especially useful for imbalanced datasets where accuracy might be misleading.

**Log-Loss (Cross-Entropy)**

Log-loss evaluates the uncertainty of the model's predictions by heavily penalizing confident incorrect predictions:

$$\text{Log Loss} = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{j=1}^{K} y_{ij} \log(p_{ij})$$

Where $y_{ij}$ is 1 if instance i belongs to class j and 0 otherwise, and $p_{ij}$ is the predicted probability.

Log-loss is particularly valuable when you need well-calibrated probability estimates, not just correct classifications.
A low log-loss indicates that the model's probability estimates align well with the actual outcomes.

**Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)**

The Matthews Correlation Coefficient provides a balanced measure even with very imbalanced classes. For multi-class
problems, it can be generalized as:

$$\text{MCC} = \frac{c \cdot s - \sum_{k} p_k \cdot t_k}{\sqrt{(s^2 - \sum_{k} p_k^2) \cdot (s^2 - \sum_{k} t_k^2)}}$$

Where:

- c is the total number of correctly predicted instances
- s is the total number of instances
- p₍ is the number of times class k was predicted
- t₍ is the number of times class k truly occurs

MCC ranges from -1 to 1, with higher values indicating better performance. It's considered one of the most balanced
measures for multi-class problems with uneven class distributions.

**Choosing the Right Metrics**

The choice of evaluation metrics should align with your specific goals:

1. Use **accuracy** when:
    - Classes are well balanced
    - All types of errors are equally costly
    - You need a simple, interpretable metric
2. Use **precision** when:
    - False positives are more costly than false negatives
    - Example: Spam detection (where marking legitimate email as spam is worse than letting spam through)
3. Use **recall** when:
    - False negatives are more costly than false positives
    - Example: Disease detection (where missing a disease is worse than a false alarm)
4. Use **F1 score** when:
    - You need a balance between precision and recall
    - Neither false positives nor false negatives are strongly preferred
5. Use **log-loss** when:
    - The quality of probability estimates matters
    - You need a nuanced view of model confidence
    - Example: Risk assessment where probability calibration is crucial
6. Use **MCC or Cohen's Kappa** when:
    - Dealing with imbalanced datasets
    - You need a single balanced measure less affected by class distributions

The best practice is to consider multiple metrics together to gain a comprehensive understanding of model performance.
For example, examining the confusion matrix alongside precision and recall for each class can reveal specific weaknesses
that a single aggregate metric might miss.

In practice, most machine learning libraries provide functions to calculate these metrics:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_recall_fscore_support, confusion_matrix
from sklearn.metrics import cohen_kappa_score, log_loss, matthews_corrcoef

# Example with true labels and predicted labels
y_true = [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 0]  # Actual classes
y_pred = [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 0]  # Predicted classes
y_prob = [  # Predicted probabilities for each class
    [0.8, 0.1, 0.1],  # First sample probabilities
    [0.1, 0.7, 0.2],
    [0.2, 0.6, 0.2],  # Note: predicted class 1 but true class is 2
    [0.7, 0.2, 0.1],
    # ... and so on
]

# Calculate various metrics
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred)
precision, recall, f1, _ = precision_recall_fscore_support(y_true, y_pred, average='weighted')
conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred)
kappa = cohen_kappa_score(y_true, y_pred)
mcc = matthews_corrcoef(y_true, y_pred)
loss = log_loss(y_true, y_prob)

print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}")
print(f"Weighted Precision: {precision:.4f}")
print(f"Weighted Recall: {recall:.4f}")
print(f"Weighted F1 Score: {f1:.4f}")
print(f"Cohen's Kappa: {kappa:.4f}")
print(f"Matthews Correlation Coefficient: {mcc:.4f}")
print(f"Log Loss: {loss:.4f}")
print("\nConfusion Matrix:")
print(conf_matrix)
```

When evaluating multi-class classifiers, it's important to consider the context of your problem. For medical
diagnostics, you might prioritize recall for serious conditions while maintaining reasonable precision. For content
recommendation, precision might be more important to ensure relevance. For financial fraud detection, you might use
cost-sensitive metrics that weigh different error types according to their financial impact.

By selecting appropriate metrics and analyzing them together, you can gain a comprehensive understanding of your model's
strengths, weaknesses, and suitability for your specific application. This multi-faceted evaluation approach helps guide
model selection, parameter tuning, and feature engineering efforts to improve performance where it matters most.

#### Logistic Regression

Logistic regression stands as one of the foundational algorithms in machine learning, bridging simple linear models and
more complex neural networks. Despite its name suggesting a regression technique, it's primarily a classification method
with a rich statistical foundation. Let's explore this powerful algorithm in depth.

##### Mathematical Formulation

Logistic regression extends linear regression by applying a transformation that constrains the output to represent a
probability. To understand this critical distinction, let's build the model step by step.

We begin with a familiar linear combination of input features, similar to linear regression:

$$z = w_0 + w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + ... + w_nx_n = \mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{x} + b$$

Here:

- $\mathbf{w} = (w_1, w_2, ..., w_n)$ is our weight vector, determining how much each feature contributes
- $\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$ is the input feature vector
- $b = w_0$ is the bias term (often incorporated into $\mathbf{w}$ by adding a constant feature $x_0 = 1$)

This linear combination $z$ (often called the "logit") could theoretically range from negative infinity to positive
infinity. But for classification, we need a value between 0 and 1 that we can interpret as a probability. This is where
the sigmoid function comes in:

$$\hat{y} = \sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{x} + b)}}$$

This S-shaped sigmoid function elegantly transforms our unbounded linear prediction into a probability value. When $z$
is large and positive, $\sigma(z)$ approaches 1; when $z$ is large and negative, $\sigma(z)$ approaches 0; and when
$z = 0$, $\sigma(z) = 0.5$.

To better understand the transformation, imagine we're predicting whether a student will pass an exam based on hours
studied. A linear model might predict "pass" for values above 0.5 and "fail" below, but the predictions wouldn't have a
probabilistic interpretation. With logistic regression, a prediction of 0.8 means "80% probability of passing," which is
much more informative.

The logistic regression model has an interesting interpretation when we examine the log-odds (or logit) of the positive
class:

$$\log\left(\frac{P(y=1|\mathbf{x})}{P(y=0|\mathbf{x})}\right) = \log\left(\frac{P(y=1|\mathbf{x})}{1-P(y=1|\mathbf{x})}\right) = \mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{x} + b$$

This reveals that logistic regression assumes a linear relationship not between the inputs and the probability directly,
but between the inputs and the log-odds of the positive class. This subtle but important distinction helps explain why
logistic regression works well for many classification problems where the underlying relationship is not strictly
linear.

For binary classification, the decision boundary (the point where the model switches from predicting class 0 to class 1)
occurs when the predicted probability equals 0.5:

$$\sigma(z) = 0.5$$

Solving for $z$, we get:

$$z = 0$$

Which means:

$$\mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{x} + b = 0$$

This is the equation of a hyperplane in the feature space. In two dimensions, this would be a straight line; in three
dimensions, a flat plane; and in higher dimensions, a hyperplane. This reveals an important limitation of logistic
regression: it can only create linear decision boundaries between classes. If your data isn't linearly separable,
logistic regression will never achieve perfect classification.

Understanding this mathematical formulation helps us see how logistic regression connects to both linear models (through
its use of linear combinations of features) and more complex neural networks (which can be viewed as extensions of
logistic regression with additional layers and non-linearities).

##### Probabilistic Interpretation

One of logistic regression's greatest strengths is its natural probabilistic interpretation, which gives it strong
theoretical foundations and makes its predictions particularly useful for decision-making under uncertainty.

The logistic regression model directly outputs the probability that an instance belongs to the positive class:

$$P(y=1|\mathbf{x}; \mathbf{w}, b) = \sigma(\mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{x} + b)$$

Consequently, the probability of the negative class is:

$$P(y=0|\mathbf{x}; \mathbf{w}, b) = 1 - P(y=1|\mathbf{x}; \mathbf{w}, b) = 1 - \sigma(\mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{x} + b)$$

We can write these probabilities more concisely as:

$$P(y|\mathbf{x}; \mathbf{w}, b) = \sigma(\mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{x} + b)^y \cdot (1 - \sigma(\mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{x} + b))^{(1-y)}$$

This is immediately recognizable as a Bernoulli distribution, where the probability parameter depends on the input
features. This connection to probability theory is not just theoretical—it has practical implications for how we train
and use logistic regression models.

Let's explore what this probabilistic interpretation means in practice with an example. Imagine we're predicting whether
a patient has a particular disease based on various medical measurements. A logistic regression model might output:

- Patient A: 0.95 probability of disease
- Patient B: 0.60 probability of disease
- Patient C: 0.30 probability of disease

Unlike a simple "yes/no" classification, these probabilities tell us about the model's confidence. For Patient A, the
model is highly confident; for Patient B, it's more uncertain. This information is crucial for medical decision-making,
where the costs of false positives and false negatives may be very different. For instance, we might set different
probability thresholds for recommending further testing (lower threshold) versus initiating treatment (higher
threshold).

From a statistical perspective, logistic regression can be derived by assuming that the data for each class comes from a
Gaussian distribution with the same covariance matrix but different means. Under this assumption, the posterior
probability follows the logistic form. This connection to generative models provides additional theoretical grounding.

The probabilistic nature of logistic regression connects it to information theory and maximum likelihood estimation.
When training a logistic regression model, we typically find parameters that maximize the likelihood of the observed
data:

$$L(\mathbf{w}, b) = \prod_{i=1}^{m} P(y^{(i)}|\mathbf{x}^{(i)}; \mathbf{w}, b)$$

Taking the logarithm (which preserves the maximum) gives the log-likelihood:

$$\ell(\mathbf{w}, b) = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \log P(y^{(i)}|\mathbf{x}^{(i)}; \mathbf{w}, b)$$

Substituting the Bernoulli probability:

$$\ell(\mathbf{w}, b) = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left[ y^{(i)} \log \sigma(z^{(i)}) + (1 - y^{(i)}) \log (1 - \sigma(z^{(i)})) \right]$$

where $z^{(i)} = \mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{x}^{(i)} + b$.

For optimization purposes, we typically minimize the negative log-likelihood, which is equivalent to minimizing the
cross-entropy loss between the predicted probabilities and the true labels:

$$J(\mathbf{w}, b) = -\frac{1}{m}\ell(\mathbf{w}, b) = -\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m} \left[ y^{(i)} \log \sigma(z^{(i)}) + (1 - y^{(i)}) \log (1 - \sigma(z^{(i)})) \right]$$

This probabilistic foundation explains why logistic regression uses cross-entropy loss rather than mean squared error
(which would be appropriate for a regression task). It also connects logistic regression to neural networks, where the
same cross-entropy loss function is commonly used for classification tasks.

Beyond providing a theoretical basis for the model, this probabilistic interpretation allows logistic regression to be
integrated into larger probabilistic frameworks, such as Bayesian networks or decision analysis systems, where
uncertainties need to be properly quantified and propagated.

##### Binary Classification Implementation

Implementing logistic regression for binary classification involves several key steps, from preparing your data to
making predictions with the trained model. Let's walk through a complete implementation, highlighting practical
considerations at each stage.

**Data Preparation:**

Before training a logistic regression model, we need to ensure our data is properly prepared:

1. **Feature scaling:** Logistic regression is sensitive to the scale of input features because larger-scale features
   can dominate the gradient updates. Standardization (subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation) or
   normalization (scaling to a fixed range, typically [0,1]) helps address this issue.

    For example, if one feature ranges from 0-1000 and another from 0-1, the first feature would dominate without
    scaling:

    ```python
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

    # Create a scaler object
    scaler = StandardScaler()

    # Fit the scaler to the training data and transform it
    X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)

    # Apply the same transformation to the test data
    X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
    ```

2. **Handling missing values:** Logistic regression can't handle missing values directly. Common strategies include:

    - Imputation with mean, median, or mode values
    - Using more sophisticated imputation techniques like k-nearest neighbors
    - Creating indicator variables to mark where values were missing

3. **Feature engineering:** Creating new features that capture important relationships can significantly improve model
   performance. Examples include:

    - Interaction terms (multiplying features together)
    - Polynomial features (e.g., squaring or cubing features)
    - Domain-specific transformations

    For instance, in a housing price model, the product of square footage and neighborhood quality might be more
    predictive than either feature alone.

**Model Initialization:**

The parameters $\mathbf{w}$ and $b$ are typically initialized to small random values or zeros. Unlike deep neural
networks, logistic regression has a convex cost function with a single global minimum, making initialization less
critical—the model will converge to the same solution regardless of starting point (though initialization can affect
convergence speed).

**Training Process:**

Logistic regression is trained by finding the parameters that minimize the cross-entropy loss. Several optimization
algorithms can be used:

1. **Gradient Descent:** The most straightforward approach updates parameters iteratively in the direction of the
   negative gradient:

    ```python
    def train_logistic_regression(X, y, learning_rate=0.01, num_iterations=1000):
        m, n = X.shape  # m samples, n features
        w = np.zeros(n)  # Initialize weights
        b = 0  # Initialize bias

        for i in range(num_iterations):
            # Forward pass: compute predictions
            z = np.dot(X, w) + b
            predictions = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-z))  # Sigmoid function

            # Compute loss
            loss = -np.mean(y * np.log(predictions) + (1 - y) * np.log(1 - predictions))

            # Compute gradients
            dw = np.dot(X.T, (predictions - y)) / m
            db = np.sum(predictions - y) / m

            # Update parameters
            w -= learning_rate * dw
            b -= learning_rate * db

            # Optionally print loss every 100 iterations
            if i % 100 == 0:
                print(f"Iteration {i}, Loss: {loss}")

        return w, b
    ```

2. **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):** Updates parameters based on a single example at a time, providing faster but
   noisier updates. This is especially useful for large datasets:

    ```python
    # In the training loop:
    for i in range(num_iterations):
        for j in range(m):  # Loop through each example
            # Select a single example
            x_j = X[j].reshape(1, -1)
            y_j = y[j]

            # Forward pass for this example
            z_j = np.dot(x_j, w) + b
            prediction_j = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-z_j))

            # Update parameters using this example
            dw = np.dot(x_j.T, (prediction_j - y_j))
            db = prediction_j - y_j

            w -= learning_rate * dw
            b -= learning_rate * db
    ```

3. **Mini-batch Gradient Descent:** A compromise between batch and stochastic approaches, using small random subsets of
   data for each update:

    ```python
    # In the training loop:
    for i in range(num_iterations):
        # Shuffle data and create mini-batches
        indices = np.random.permutation(m)
        for start_idx in range(0, m, batch_size):
            batch_indices = indices[start_idx:start_idx + batch_size]
            X_batch = X[batch_indices]
            y_batch = y[batch_indices]

            # Forward pass for this batch
            z_batch = np.dot(X_batch, w) + b
            predictions_batch = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-z_batch))

            # Update parameters using this batch
            dw = np.dot(X_batch.T, (predictions_batch - y_batch)) / len(batch_indices)
            db = np.sum(predictions_batch - y_batch) / len(batch_indices)

            w -= learning_rate * dw
            b -= learning_rate * db
    ```

4. **Regularized Training:** To prevent overfitting, regularization terms are often added to the cost function:

    - L1 regularization (Lasso): $J_{L1}(\mathbf{w}, b) = J(\mathbf{w}, b) + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^{n} |w_j|$
    - L2 regularization (Ridge): $J_{L2}(\mathbf{w}, b) = J(\mathbf{w}, b) + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^{n} w_j^2$
    - Elastic Net: A combination of L1 and L2

    L1 regularization promotes sparsity (many weights become exactly zero), effectively performing feature selection. L2
    regularization prevents any single feature from dominating by penalizing large weights.

    To implement L2 regularization:

    ```python
    # Modify the loss function
    loss = -np.mean(y * np.log(predictions) + (1 - y) * np.log(1 - predictions)) + (lambda_param / (2 * m)) * np.sum(w**2)

    # Modify the gradient for weights (not for bias)
    dw = np.dot(X.T, (predictions - y)) / m + (lambda_param / m) * w
    ```

In practice, more advanced optimization methods like BFGS or L-BFGS are often used as they converge faster and require
less tuning than gradient descent:

```python
from scipy.optimize import minimize

def log_likelihood(params, X, y):
    # Extract weights and bias
    w = params[:-1]
    b = params[-1]

    # Compute predictions
    z = np.dot(X, w) + b
    predictions = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-z))

    # Compute negative log-likelihood
    ll = -np.sum(y * np.log(predictions) + (1 - y) * np.log(1 - predictions))

    return ll

# Initial parameter guess
initial_params = np.zeros(X.shape[1] + 1)

# Minimize negative log-likelihood
result = minimize(log_likelihood, initial_params, args=(X, y), method='L-BFGS-B')

# Extract optimized parameters
optimal_params = result.x
w_optimal = optimal_params[:-1]
b_optimal = optimal_params[-1]
```

**Making Predictions:**

Once trained, the model makes predictions by:

1. Computing the logit: $z = \mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{x} + b$
2. Applying the sigmoid function: $\hat{p} = \sigma(z)$
3. Converting to class labels based on a threshold (typically 0.5):

```python
def predict(X, w, b, threshold=0.5):
    # Compute logits
    z = np.dot(X, w) + b

    # Apply sigmoid to get probabilities
    probabilities = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-z))

    # Convert to class labels
    predictions = (probabilities >= threshold).astype(int)

    return predictions, probabilities
```

The threshold can be adjusted based on the specific problem requirements. For instance, in cancer detection, you might
lower the threshold to increase sensitivity (catching more potential cases), accepting more false positives as a
trade-off.

**Evaluation:**

To evaluate the model's performance, several metrics are commonly used:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score, roc_auc_score

y_pred, y_prob = predict(X_test, w, b)

# Classification metrics
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
precision = precision_score(y_test, y_pred)
recall = recall_score(y_test, y_pred)
f1 = f1_score(y_test, y_pred)

# Probability-based metric
auc = roc_auc_score(y_test, y_prob)

print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}")
print(f"Precision: {precision:.4f}")
print(f"Recall: {recall:.4f}")
print(f"F1 Score: {f1:.4f}")
print(f"AUC-ROC: {auc:.4f}")
```

A practical implementation in scikit-learn simplifies many of these steps:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Scale features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Train model
model = LogisticRegression(C=1.0, penalty='l2', solver='lbfgs', max_iter=1000)
model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test_scaled)
y_pred_proba = model.predict_proba(X_test_scaled)[:, 1]

# Evaluate
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

This implementation encapsulates the key steps while allowing for customization through parameters like the
regularization strength (`C`), penalty type, and solver algorithm.

##### Multi-Class Extension

Logistic regression can be extended from binary classification to handle multiple classes through several approaches.
The two most common methods are One-vs-Rest (OvR) and Multinomial Logistic Regression (also known as Softmax
Regression).

**1. One-vs-Rest (OvR) Approach:**

The One-vs-Rest approach (sometimes called One-vs-All) takes a divide-and-conquer strategy by breaking down the
multi-class problem into multiple binary classification problems. For a problem with $K$ classes, we train $K$ separate
binary logistic regression models, where each model is trained to distinguish one class from all the others combined.

For each class $k \in {1, 2, ..., K}$, we train a binary classifier with the following mapping:

- Examples from class $k$ are labeled as positive (1)
- Examples from all other classes are labeled as negative (0)

This gives us $K$ separate models, each producing a probability that an example belongs to its respective class:

$$P(y=k|\mathbf{x}; \mathbf{w}_k, b_k) = \sigma(\mathbf{w}_k^T\mathbf{x} + b_k)$$

Where $\mathbf{w}_k$ and $b_k$ are the parameters for the $k$-th model.

During prediction, we apply all $K$ models to the input and select the class with the highest probability:

$$\hat{y} = \arg\max_{k \in {1,2,...,K}} P(y=k|\mathbf{x}; \mathbf{w}_k, b_k)$$

Let's walk through an example with a 3-class problem (classifying fruits as apples, bananas, or cherries):

1. Train three binary classifiers:
    - Model 1: Apple (1) vs. Not Apple (0)
    - Model 2: Banana (1) vs. Not Banana (0)
    - Model 3: Cherry (1) vs. Not Cherry (0)
2. For a new example, compute probability from each model:
    - P(Apple) = 0.3
    - P(Banana) = 0.6
    - P(Cherry) = 0.2
3. Predict the class with highest probability (Banana in this case)

Note that these probabilities don't necessarily sum to 1, since each model was trained independently.

The OvR approach has several advantages:

- Simplicity and direct extension from binary logistic regression
- Each classifier can be trained and updated independently
- Often works well even when classes are imbalanced
- Can be parallelized easily since models are independent

And some limitations:

- Training $K$ separate models can be computationally expensive for many classes
- Does not directly model the joint probability distribution
- Class probabilities may not be directly comparable
- May struggle with classes that aren't linearly separable from the combination of all others

Here's a simple implementation of OvR using scikit-learn:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.multiclass import OneVsRestClassifier

# Create a OneVsRest classifier using logistic regression as the base estimator
ovr_model = OneVsRestClassifier(LogisticRegression(solver='lbfgs', max_iter=1000))

# Train the model
ovr_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = ovr_model.predict(X_test)
y_prob = ovr_model.predict_proba(X_test)
```

**2. Multinomial Logistic Regression (Softmax Regression):**

Multinomial logistic regression extends the binary case more directly by modeling the probability distribution over all
classes simultaneously. Instead of the sigmoid function, it uses the softmax function to convert raw scores (logits)
into a probability distribution:

$$P(y=k|\mathbf{x}; \mathbf{W}, \mathbf{b}) = \frac{e^{\mathbf{w}*k^T\mathbf{x} + b_k}}{\sum*{j=1}^{K} e^{\mathbf{w}_j^T\mathbf{x} + b_j}}$$

Where:

- $\mathbf{W} = [\mathbf{w}_1, \mathbf{w}_2, ..., \mathbf{w}_K]$ is the weight matrix containing all weight vectors
- $\mathbf{b} = [b_1, b_2, ..., b_K]$ is the bias vector

During prediction, the model selects the class with the highest probability:

$$\hat{y} = \arg\max_{k \in {1,2,...,K}} P(y=k|\mathbf{x}; \mathbf{W}, \mathbf{b})$$

Training involves minimizing the negative log-likelihood (cross-entropy loss):

$$J(\mathbf{W}, \mathbf{b}) = -\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \sum_{k=1}^{K} \mathbb{1}{y^{(i)} = k} \log P(y^{(i)}=k|\mathbf{x}^{(i)}; \mathbf{W}, \mathbf{b})$$

Where $\mathbb{1}{y^{(i)} = k}$ is an indicator function that equals 1 when $y^{(i)} = k$ and 0 otherwise.

Let's continue with our fruit classification example using multinomial logistic regression:

1. Train a single model with parameters for all three classes (weight vectors $\mathbf{w}*{\text{apple}}$,
   $\mathbf{w}*{\text{banana}}$, $\mathbf{w}_{\text{cherry}}$ and bias terms)
2. For a new example, compute logits for each class:
    - $z_{\text{apple}} = \mathbf{w}*{\text{apple}}^T\mathbf{x} + b*{\text{apple}} = 1.2$
    - $z_{\text{banana}} = \mathbf{w}*{\text{banana}}^T\mathbf{x} + b*{\text{banana}} = 2.5$
    - $z_{\text{cherry}} = \mathbf{w}*{\text{cherry}}^T\mathbf{x} + b*{\text{cherry}} = 0.8$
3. Apply softmax to get probabilities:
    - $\text{P(Apple)} = \frac{e^{1.2}}{e^{1.2} + e^{2.5} + e^{0.8}} \approx 0.22$
    - $\text{P(Banana)} = \frac{e^{2.5}}{e^{1.2} + e^{2.5} + e^{0.8}} \approx 0.65$
    - $\text{P(Cherry)} = \frac{e^{0.8}}{e^{1.2} + e^{2.5} + e^{0.8}} \approx 0.13$
4. Predict the class with highest probability (Banana)

Note that these probabilities always sum to 1, creating a proper probability distribution.

Advantages of multinomial logistic regression include:

- Directly models the probability distribution over all classes
- Often provides better calibrated probabilities
- More efficient than training multiple binary classifiers
- Takes into account the relationships between all classes simultaneously

Limitations include:

- More complex to implement from scratch
- Training all parameters simultaneously can be computationally intensive for many classes
- May struggle with highly imbalanced classes

Here's how to use multinomial logistic regression in scikit-learn:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Create a multinomial logistic regression model
multi_model = LogisticRegression(multi_class='multinomial', solver='lbfgs', max_iter=1000)

# Train the model
multi_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = multi_model.predict(X_test)
y_prob = multi_model.predict_proba(X_test)
```

**Implementation Considerations:**

Several practical considerations affect the choice between OvR and multinomial approaches:

1. **Parameter sharing:** In multinomial logistic regression, the same features are used for all classes, but with
   different weights. This creates a more coherent model than OvR.

2. **Regularization:** L1 or L2 regularization can be applied to both approaches to prevent overfitting:

    ```python
    # L2 regularization with C=1.0 (smaller C means stronger regularization)
    model = LogisticRegression(C=1.0, penalty='l2', multi_class='multinomial')

    # L1 regularization for feature selection
    model = LogisticRegression(C=1.0, penalty='l1', solver='saga', multi_class='multinomial')
    ```

3. **Computational efficiency:** For large numbers of classes, OvR might be more efficient since each model can be
   trained independently and in parallel.

4. **Probability calibration:** Multinomial logistic regression typically provides better calibrated probabilities than
   OvR, where probabilities from different binary classifiers may not be directly comparable.

5. **Class imbalance:** OvR can sometimes handle highly imbalanced classes better since each binary classifier can be
   separately optimized or weighted.

In most cases, when the number of classes is moderate (say, less than 10), multinomial logistic regression is preferred
for its coherent probability model and often superior performance. For problems with many classes or where parallel
training is important, OvR can be more practical.

Both approaches extend logistic regression's capabilities while maintaining its core strength: providing interpretable
probabilistic outputs that make it valuable for classification tasks where understanding the confidence of predictions
is important.

##### Gradient Calculation Process

Understanding the gradient calculation process is essential for implementing logistic regression using gradient-based
optimization methods. The gradient tells us how to adjust each parameter to reduce the error, guiding the learning
process. Let's walk through this calculation step-by-step.

We'll start with the binary logistic regression cost function (cross-entropy loss):

$$J(\mathbf{w}, b) = -\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m} \left[ y^{(i)} \log \sigma(z^{(i)}) + (1 - y^{(i)}) \log (1 - \sigma(z^{(i)})) \right]$$

where $z^{(i)} = \mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{x}^{(i)} + b$ and $\sigma(z^{(i)}) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z^{(i)}}}$.

To update our parameters using gradient descent, we need to find the partial derivatives of this cost function with
respect to each parameter: $\nabla_{\mathbf{w}} J(\mathbf{w}, b)$ and $\nabla_{b} J(\mathbf{w}, b)$.

**Step 1: Calculate the Derivative of the Sigmoid Function**

The sigmoid function has an elegant derivative that will be useful in our calculations:

$$\sigma'(z) = \frac{d}{dz}\sigma(z) = \frac{d}{dz}\left(\frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}\right)$$

Using the quotient rule of calculus:

$$\sigma'(z) = \frac{0 \cdot (1+e^{-z}) - 1 \cdot (-e^{-z})}{(1+e^{-z})^2} = \frac{e^{-z}}{(1+e^{-z})^2}$$

With a bit of algebraic manipulation:

$$\sigma'(z) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-z}} \cdot \frac{e^{-z}}{1+e^{-z}} = \sigma(z)(1 - \sigma(z))$$

This elegant form of the derivative will simplify our subsequent calculations.

**Step 2: Calculate the Partial Derivative with Respect to $z^{(i)} $ **

For convenience, let's denote $\hat{y}^{(i)} = \sigma(z^{(i)}) $ as our predicted probability. The partial derivative of
the cost function with respect to $z^{(i)} $ is:

$$\begin{align} \frac{\partial}{\partial z^{(i)}} J(\mathbf{w}, b) &= -\frac{1}{m}\frac{\partial}{\partial z^{(i)}} \left[ y^{(i)} \log \hat{y}^{(i)} + (1 - y^{(i)}) \log (1 - \hat{y}^{(i)}) \right] \ \end{align}$$

Using the chain rule, we have:

$$\begin{align} \frac{\partial}{\partial z^{(i)}} J(\mathbf{w}, b) &= -\frac{1}{m}\left[ \frac{y^{(i)}}{\hat{y}^{(i)}}\frac{\partial \hat{y}^{(i)}}{\partial z^{(i)}} + \frac{1 - y^{(i)}}{1 - \hat{y}^{(i)}}\frac{\partial (1 - \hat{y}^{(i)})}{\partial z^{(i)}} \right] \ \end{align}$$

Now, $\frac{\partial \hat{y}^{(i)}}{\partial z^{(i)}} = \sigma'(z^{(i)}) = \hat{y}^{(i)}(1 - \hat{y}^{(i)})$ from Step
1, and $\frac{\partial (1 - \hat{y}^{(i)})}{\partial z^{(i)}} = -\hat{y}^{(i)}(1 - \hat{y}^{(i)})$.

Substituting these expressions:

$$\begin{align} \frac{\partial}{\partial z^{(i)}} J(\mathbf{w}, b) &= -\frac{1}{m}\left[ \frac{y^{(i)}}{\hat{y}^{(i)}}\hat{y}^{(i)}(1 - \hat{y}^{(i)}) - \frac{1 - y^{(i)}}{1 - \hat{y}^{(i)}}\hat{y}^{(i)}(1 - \hat{y}^{(i)}) \right] \ &= -\frac{1}{m}\left[ y^{(i)}(1 - \hat{y}^{(i)}) - (1 - y^{(i)})\hat{y}^{(i)} \right] \ \end{align}$$

Let's expand this expression:

$$\begin{align} \frac{\partial}{\partial z^{(i)}} J(\mathbf{w}, b) &= -\frac{1}{m}\left[ y^{(i)} - y^{(i)}\hat{y}^{(i)} - \hat{y}^{(i)} + y^{(i)}\hat{y}^{(i)} \right] \ &= -\frac{1}{m}\left[ y^{(i)} - \hat{y}^{(i)} \right] \ &= \frac{1}{m}(\hat{y}^{(i)} - y^{(i)}) \end{align}$$

This is a remarkably simple form: the partial derivative with respect to $z^{(i)}$ is proportional to the prediction
error ($\hat{y}^{(i)} - y^{(i)}$). This elegant result will make our gradient calculations much more straightforward.

**Step 3: Calculate the Gradients with Respect to Parameters**

Now, we can use the chain rule to calculate the gradients with respect to each weight $w_j$ and the bias $b$:

For a particular weight $w_j$:

$$\begin{align} \frac{\partial J}{\partial w_j} &= \sum_{i=1}^{m} \frac{\partial J}{\partial z^{(i)}} \frac{\partial z^{(i)}}{\partial w_j} \ \end{align}$$

Since $z^{(i)} = \mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{x}^{(i)} + b$, we have $\frac{\partial z^{(i)}}{\partial w_j} = x_j^{(i)}$ (the
j-th feature of the i-th example). Substituting:

$$\begin{align} \frac{\partial J}{\partial w_j} &= \sum_{i=1}^{m} \frac{1}{m}(\hat{y}^{(i)} - y^{(i)}) \cdot x_j^{(i)} \ &= \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m} (\hat{y}^{(i)} - y^{(i)})x_j^{(i)} \ \end{align}$$

Similarly for the bias:

$$\begin{align} \frac{\partial J}{\partial b} &= \sum_{i=1}^{m} \frac{\partial J}{\partial z^{(i)}} \frac{\partial z^{(i)}}{\partial b} \ \end{align}$$

Since $\frac{\partial z^{(i)}}{\partial b} = 1$, we have:

$$\begin{align} \frac{\partial J}{\partial b} &= \sum_{i=1}^{m} \frac{1}{m}(\hat{y}^{(i)} - y^{(i)}) \cdot 1 \ &= \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m} (\hat{y}^{(i)} - y^{(i)}) \ \end{align}$$

These gradient expressions have intuitive interpretations:

- The gradient for each weight $w_j$ is the average of the prediction errors, weighted by the corresponding feature
  value $x_j^{(i)}$. This means that features with larger values have a stronger influence on the gradient, and the
  direction of the update depends on whether the prediction was too high (positive error) or too low (negative error).
- The gradient for the bias $b$ is simply the average of the prediction errors. It serves as a baseline adjustment for
  all predictions.

In vector form, the gradient with respect to the entire weight vector can be written as:

$$\nabla_{\mathbf{w}} J(\mathbf{w}, b) = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m} (\hat{y}^{(i)} - y^{(i)})\mathbf{x}^{(i)}$$

This compact form makes implementation efficient, especially when using vectorized operations in libraries like NumPy.

**Gradient Descent Update Rules**

Using these gradients, the parameter update rules for gradient descent are:

$$\mathbf{w} := \mathbf{w} - \alpha \cdot \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m} (\hat{y}^{(i)} - y^{(i)})\mathbf{x}^{(i)}$$

$$b := b - \alpha \cdot \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m} (\hat{y}^{(i)} - y^{(i)})$$

Where $\alpha$ is the learning rate, controlling how large a step we take in the direction of the negative gradient.

To illustrate with a concrete example, imagine we have a small dataset with three features and four training examples:

```
X = [[0.5, 1.5, 2.0],  # Example 1
     [1.0, 2.0, 1.0],  # Example 2
     [1.5, 0.5, 0.5],  # Example 3
     [2.0, 1.0, 1.5]]  # Example 4

y = [0, 1, 0, 1]       # True labels
```

And current parameter values:

```
w = [0.2, -0.1, 0.3]
b = 0.1
```

Let's calculate the gradients and update the parameters:

1. Calculate predictions ($\hat{y}^{(i)}$) for each example:
    - Example 1: $z^{(1)} = 0.2×0.5 + (-0.1)×1.5 + 0.3×2.0 + 0.1 = 0.1 + (-0.15) + 0.6 + 0.1 = 0.65$
      $\hat{y}^{(1)} = \sigma(0.65) \approx 0.657$
    - Example 2: $z^{(2)} = 0.2×1.0 + (-0.1)×2.0 + 0.3×1.0 + 0.1 = 0.2 + (-0.2) + 0.3 + 0.1 = 0.4$
      $\hat{y}^{(2)} = \sigma(0.4) \approx 0.599$
    - Example 3: $z^{(3)} = 0.2×1.5 + (-0.1)×0.5 + 0.3×0.5 + 0.1 = 0.3 + (-0.05) + 0.15 + 0.1 = 0.5$
      $\hat{y}^{(3)} = \sigma(0.5) \approx 0.622$
    - Example 4: $z^{(4)} = 0.2×2.0 + (-0.1)×1.0 + 0.3×1.5 + 0.1 = 0.4 + (-0.1) + 0.45 + 0.1 = 0.85$
      $\hat{y}^{(4)} = \sigma(0.85) \approx 0.701$
2. Calculate errors ($\hat{y}^{(i)} - y^{(i)}$) for each example:
    - Example 1: $0.657 - 0 = 0.657$
    - Example 2: $0.599 - 1 = -0.401$
    - Example 3: $0.622 - 0 = 0.622$
    - Example 4: $0.701 - 1 = -0.299$
3. Calculate gradients for each parameter:
    - For $w_1$:
      $\frac{\partial J}{\partial w_1} = \frac{1}{4}(0.657×0.5 + (-0.401)×1.0 + 0.622×1.5 + (-0.299)×2.0) \approx 0.039$
    - For $w_2$:
      $\frac{\partial J}{\partial w_2} = \frac{1}{4}(0.657×1.5 + (-0.401)×2.0 + 0.622×0.5 + (-0.299)×1.0) \approx -0.053$
    - For $w_3$:
      $\frac{\partial J}{\partial w_3} = \frac{1}{4}(0.657×2.0 + (-0.401)×1.0 + 0.622×0.5 + (-0.299)×1.5) \approx 0.097$
    - For $b$: $\frac{\partial J}{\partial b} = \frac{1}{4}(0.657 + (-0.401) + 0.622 + (-0.299)) \approx 0.145$
4. Update parameters with learning rate $\alpha = 0.1$:
    - $w_1 := 0.2 - 0.1×0.039 = 0.196$
    - $w_2 := -0.1 - 0.1×(-0.053) = -0.095$
    - $w_3 := 0.3 - 0.1×0.097 = 0.290$
    - $b := 0.1 - 0.1×0.145 = 0.086$

This update moves the parameters in the direction that reduces the cross-entropy loss.

**Regularized Gradient Calculation**

When using regularization to prevent overfitting, the gradient calculation needs to include the derivative of the
regularization term.

For L2 regularization:

$$J_{L2}(\mathbf{w}, b) = J(\mathbf{w}, b) + \frac{\lambda}{2m}\sum_{j=1}^{n} w_j^2$$

The gradient for each weight becomes:

$$\frac{\partial J_{L2}}{\partial w_j} = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m} (\hat{y}^{(i)} - y^{(i)})x_j^{(i)} + \frac{\lambda}{m}w_j$$

For L1 regularization:

$$J_{L1}(\mathbf{w}, b) = J(\mathbf{w}, b) + \frac{\lambda}{m}\sum_{j=1}^{n} |w_j|$$

The gradient includes the subgradient of the absolute value function:

$$\frac{\partial J_{L1}}{\partial w_j} = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m} (\hat{y}^{(i)} - y^{(i)})x_j^{(i)} + \frac{\lambda}{m}\text{sign}(w_j)$$

Where $\text{sign}(w_j)$ is 1 if $w_j > 0$, -1 if $w_j < 0$, and 0 if $w_j = 0$.

Note that the bias term $b$ is typically not regularized, as doing so would introduce an unwanted dependence on the
coordinate system.

**Multi-class Extension**

For multinomial logistic regression, the gradients are calculated similarly but using the softmax function. For class
$k$, the partial derivative with respect to the logit becomes:

$$\frac{\partial J}{\partial z_k^{(i)}} = \frac{1}{m}(p_k^{(i)} - \mathbb{1}{y^{(i)} = k})$$

Where $p_k^{(i)}$ is the predicted probability for class $k$ and $\mathbb{1}{y^{(i)} = k}$ is an indicator function that
equals 1 if example $i$ belongs to class $k$ and 0 otherwise.

The gradient calculation then proceeds as before, using the chain rule to compute gradients with respect to the weights
and biases for each class.

This efficient gradient calculation process enables the effective training of logistic regression models using various
optimization algorithms. Understanding these derivatives provides insight into how the model learns from data and how
different features influence the predictions. It also forms the foundation for more complex neural network architectures
that build upon these same principles of gradient-based learning.
