Neural networks with non-linear activations work like universal function approximators. There is some function that maps your input to the output. For example, images of handwritten digits to class probabilities. The power of neural networks is that we can train them to approximate this function, and basically any function given enough data and compute time.\n",

For this we calculate a **loss function** (also called the cost), a measure of our prediction error.

To get to the minimum in the least amount of time, we then want to follow the gradient (downwards). You can think of this like descending a mountain by following the steepest slope to the base.\n",

    "## Losses in PyTorch\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by seeing how we calculate the loss with PyTorch. Through the `nn` module, PyTorch provides losses such as the cross-entropy loss (`nn.CrossEntropyLoss`). You'll usually see the loss assigned to `criterion`. As noted in the last part, with a classification problem such as MNIST, we're using the softmax function to predict class probabilities. With a softmax output, you want to use cross-entropy as the loss. To actually calculate the loss, you first define the criterion then pass in the output of your network and the correct labels.\n",

    ">\n",
    "> The input is expected to contain scores for each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means we need to pass in the raw output of our network into the loss, not the output of the softmax function. This raw output is usually called the *logits* or *scores*. We use the logits because softmax gives you probabilities which will often be very close to zero or one but floating-point numbers can't accurately represent values near zero or one ([read more here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html)). It's usually best to avoid doing calculations with probabilities, typically we use log-probabilities."

We can use it to calculate the gradients of all our parameters with respect to the loss. Autograd works by keeping track of operations performed on tensors, then going backwards through those operations, calculating gradients along the way. To make sure PyTorch keeps track of operations on a tensor and calculates the gradients, you need to set `requires_grad = True` on a tensor. You can do this at creation with the `requires_grad` keyword, or at any time with `x.requires_grad_(True)`.\n",

    "\n",
    "###### Fundamental Concept: How Neural Networks Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks learn by iteratively adjusting their weights to minimize prediction errors. This process, called **gradient descent**, follows a simple mathematical principle: move weights in the direction opposite to the gradient (steepest ascent) to find the minimum loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### The Mathematical Foundation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gradient Descent Update Rule:**\n",
    "$$w_{new} = w_{old} - \\alpha \\nabla w$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $w_{old}$ = current weight value\n",
    "- $\\alpha$ = learning rate (step size)\n",
    "- $\\nabla w$ = gradient (partial derivative of loss with respect to weight)\n",
    "- $w_{new}$ = updated weight value\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Subtract the Gradient?**\n",
    "The gradient points in the direction of steepest increase in the loss function. To minimize loss, we move in the opposite direction (hence the minus sign).\n",
    "\n",
    "###### The Training Process Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Initialize**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Creates an SGD optimizer with learning rate α = 0.01.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Clear Previous Gradients**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "optimizer.zero_grad()\n",
    "```\n",
    "Gradients accumulate by default in PyTorch, so we must clear them each iteration.\n",

    "output = model(images)\n",
    "loss = criterion(output, labels)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Compute predictions and measure error against true labels.\n",

    "###### Understanding Gradient Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gradient Structure Analysis:**\n",
    "The gradients show identical values across each row:\n",

    "Row 1: [-0.0006, -0.0006, -0.0006, ...]  # All negative\n",

    "Row 3: [+0.0002, +0.0002, +0.0002, ...]  # All positive\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "- Each row represents one output neuron (class)\n",
    "- Identical gradients within a row suggest the neuron needs uniform adjustment across all input features\n",
    "- Sign indicates direction: negative gradients → weights increase, positive gradients → weights decrease\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Learning Rate Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "**Small Learning Rate (0.01):**\n",
    "- Advantages: Stable learning, fine-tuned adjustments\n",
    "- Weight changes: ~0.00001 to 0.00004 (very small steps)\n",
    "- Risk: Slow convergence\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Relationship:**\n",
    "$$|\\Delta w| = \\alpha \\times |\\nabla w| = 0.01 \\times 0.0011 = 0.000011$$\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Key Learning Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gradient Descent Direction:** Always moves opposite to gradient direction to minimize loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step Size Control:** Learning rate balances stability (small α) vs. speed (large α).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Iterative Refinement:** Each update slightly improves the model's ability to minimize prediction error.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Convergence Goal:** Through many iterations, weights converge toward values that minimize the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process repeats for thousands of iterations across the entire dataset, gradually sculpting the neural network's weights to accurately map inputs to desired outputs.\n",
