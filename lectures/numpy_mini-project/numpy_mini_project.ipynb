    "##### Mean Normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning we use large amounts of data to train our models. Some machine learning algorithms may require that the data is *normalized* in order to work correctly. The idea of normalization, also known as *feature scaling*, is to ensure that all the data is on a similar scale, *i.e.* that all the data takes on a similar range of values. For example, we might have a dataset that has values between 0 and 5,000. By normalizing the data we can make the range of values be between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will be performing a different kind of feature scaling known as *mean normalization*. Mean normalization will scale the data, but instead of making the values be between 0 and 1, it will distribute the values evenly in some small interval around zero. For example, if we have a dataset that has values between 0 and 5,000, after mean normalization the range of values will be distributed in some small range around 0, for example between -3 to 3. Because the range of values are distributed evenly around zero, this guarantees that the average (mean) of all elements will be zero. Therefore, when you perform *mean normalization* your data will not only be scaled but it will also have an average of zero. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### To Do:\n",
    "\n",
    "You will start by importing NumPy and creating a rank 2 ndarray of random integers between 0 and 5,000 (inclusive) with 1000 rows and 20 columns. This array will simulate a dataset with a wide range of values. Fill in the code below"

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting `(20, 1)`\n",
    "\n",
    "`keepdims=True` will produce a shape of `(1, 20)` because you aggregated along the rows (axis 0). To get the `(20, 1)` shape you're asking for, you can simply **reshape** the result or **transpose** it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Reshape:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "ave_cols_reshaped = ave_cols_squeezed.reshape(20, 1)\n",
    "print(\"Reshaped shape:\", ave_cols_reshaped.shape) # Prints (20, 1)\n",

    "print(\"Transposed shape:\", ave_cols_transposed.shape) # Prints (20, 1)\n",
